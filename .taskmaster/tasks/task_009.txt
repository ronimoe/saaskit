# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create API Routes and Business Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement all API routes for authentication, billing, team management, and projects with comprehensive testing coverage
# Details:
Create API routes in apps/main-app/app/api/ for auth callback, billing (checkout, portal, webhooks), team management (invite, members), projects CRUD, and health checks. Implement proper error handling, request validation, and response formatting. Follow service layer pattern for future migration readiness. Include comprehensive testing with Vitest targeting 85% code coverage minimum.

# Test Strategy:
Test all API endpoints with various input scenarios, verify proper error responses, test webhook signature validation, validate request/response types match TypeScript definitions, ensure proper authentication middleware, and achieve 85% code coverage with comprehensive unit tests covering both happy path and edge cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Route Structure and Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure and endpoints for authentication, billing, team management, projects CRUD, and health checks in the apps/main-app/app/api/ directory.
### Details:
Map out all required API routes, ensuring clear separation of concerns and RESTful design. Document endpoint paths, HTTP methods, and expected request/response formats.

## 2. Implement Authentication and Authorization Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API routes, ensuring secure access control.
### Details:
Integrate OAuth2 or similar frameworks, enforce HTTPS, validate tokens, and apply role-based access controls. Follow best practices for secure credential handling and input validation[1][2][5].

## 3. Develop Business Logic and Service Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement the core business logic for billing, team management, and project operations using a service layer pattern.
### Details:
Encapsulate business rules and data access in service classes to enable future migration and maintainability. Ensure separation from route handlers.

## 4. Integrate Error Handling, Request Validation, and Response Formatting [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling, input validation, and standardized response formatting to all API routes.
### Details:
Implement middleware or utilities for consistent error responses, validate all incoming data, and format API responses according to specification[5].

## 5. Implement Security, Logging, and Health Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Enhance API security, add logging/monitoring, and implement health check endpoints.
### Details:
Apply rate limiting, secure secrets management, and logging for auditing and troubleshooting. Create health check endpoints for system monitoring[5].
