# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Monorepo Infrastructure and Tooling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the monorepo structure with Turbo, TypeScript configurations, shared tooling, and a demo Next.js application for the SaaS platform. Reference and implement the planned folder structure from PRD.md as a guide for all developers. The structure includes: apps/ (for Next.js applications like main-app and marketing-site), packages/ (for shared code such as supabase, billing, auth, email, ui, lib, types), supabase/ (for database migrations and functions), tools/ (for shared tooling like eslint-config, tsconfig, and vitest-config), and tests/ (for E2E tests). Ensure this structure is created during initialization and matches the detailed hierarchy in PRD.md so developers know exactly where to place files.
# Details:
Create root package.json with pnpm workspace configuration, setup pnpm-workspace.yaml, setup Turbo for build orchestration, configure shared TypeScript configs in tools/tsconfig/, setup ESLint and Prettier configurations, configure Vitest workspace for testing infrastructure, and establish the complete folder structure as specified in the PRD. The folder structure must include: apps/ (Next.js apps such as main-app, marketing-site), packages/ (shared code: supabase, billing, auth, email, ui, lib, types), supabase/ (database migrations/functions), tools/ (eslint-config, tsconfig, vitest-config), and tests/ (E2E tests). Reference the detailed structure in PRD.md for the full hierarchy. Initialize git repository with proper .gitignore and environment variable templates. Add pnpm-lock.yaml to git. Additionally, create a basic Next.js app in apps/web that displays 'Hello SaaS Kit!', includes a page showing the monorepo structure and packages, and provides a landing page listing all packages. Ensure the app can be run with 'pnpm run dev' and is accessible at localhost:3000 to demonstrate the infrastructure is working.

# Test Strategy:
Verify workspace installation with 'pnpm install', test Turbo build commands, validate TypeScript compilation across packages, run Vitest tests across all packages to ensure testing infrastructure works. Run 'pnpm run dev' in apps/web and confirm the Next.js app is accessible at localhost:3000, displaying the landing page with the monorepo structure and package list. Confirm that the initialized folder structure matches the reference from PRD.md and includes all required directories. Verify that pnpm workspace dependencies are correctly resolved between packages and that Vitest can run tests across the entire workspace.

# Subtasks:

<info added on 2025-06-08T09:33:26.545Z>
## Implementation Analysis & Plan

### Current State:
- `tools/tsconfig/` directory exists with base configurations
- Has: `base.json`, `react-library.json`, `nextjs.json`, `package.json`
- Missing: `node.json` (referenced in package.json but doesn't exist)
- Apps like main-app already extend `@repo/tsconfig/nextjs.json` correctly
- Packages like UI package aren't using shared configs (using inline config instead)

### Issues Found:
1. Missing `node.json` configuration for Node.js packages (Supabase functions, etc.)
2. UI package and other packages aren't extending shared configs
3. No path mapping configuration for cross-package imports in base configs
4. Package.json in tsconfig references non-existent `node.json`

### Implementation Plan:
1. Create missing `node.json` configuration for Node.js environments
2. Add path mapping support for monorepo package imports in base config
3. Update existing package tsconfig.json files to extend shared configurations
4. Test configurations by verifying TypeScript compilation across packages
5. Ensure pnpm workspace package references work correctly

### Files to create/modify:
- Create: `tools/tsconfig/node.json`
- Update: `tools/tsconfig/base.json` (add path mapping)
- Update: `packages/*/tsconfig.json` files to extend shared configs
- Potentially add other specialized configs if needed

### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up pnpm workspace configuration for efficient package management across the monorepo
### Details:
Create pnpm-workspace.yaml file in the root directory to define workspace packages. Configure package.json scripts to use pnpm for all operations (install, add, run). Set up proper workspace dependency references using pnpm syntax (e.g., 'workspace:*' or 'workspace:^'). Add pnpm-lock.yaml to git tracking. Document pnpm-specific commands for common operations in the monorepo. Configure .npmrc if needed for specific pnpm settings. Ensure all package.json files in the monorepo use consistent pnpm configurations.
<info added on 2025-06-08T10:17:25.156Z>
Current state analysis completed - pnpm workspace is functional with 11 packages properly detected and workspace linking operational. Key findings: .npmrc file missing for pnpm optimizations, documentation needed for common workspace commands, package.json scripts inconsistent across packages, and cross-package dependency validation required. Implementation plan established to address these gaps: create .npmrc with pnpm settings, standardize scripts across all packages, develop comprehensive pnpm workspace documentation, test dependency resolution between packages, and validate workspace configuration with dependency changes.

## 9. Configure Vitest Workspace and Testing Foundation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Set up Vitest workspace configuration for all packages in the monorepo using pnpm
### Details:
Install Vitest and related dependencies using 'pnpm add -D vitest @vitest/ui jsdom @testing-library/jest-dom' in the root workspace. Create vitest.workspace.ts in the root directory to configure Vitest for all packages in the monorepo. Set up tools/vitest-config/ directory with shared Vitest configurations that can be extended by individual packages. Configure test scripts in the root package.json using pnpm. Ensure pnpm workspace dependencies are configured for shared test utilities. Create basic test setup files and utilities that can be used across all packages. Configure Vitest to work with TypeScript and support testing of React components.
<info added on 2025-06-08T10:37:40.269Z>
Created comprehensive analysis of current monorepo state revealing that turbo.json already has test tasks configured and expects vitest.config.* files. Identified that tools/vitest-config directory exists but is empty, and individual packages lack test scripts. Developed implementation plan to create shared vitest configuration in tools/vitest-config, establish vitest workspace configuration at root level, add vitest dependencies to root package.json, configure individual packages with test scripts, create base vitest configurations for different package types (React components, utilities, etc.), set up test utilities and setup files, and verify configuration works across the monorepo. Plan ensures workspace-aware testing with proper module resolution, supports both unit and integration testing, and follows established "@saas/*" and "@repo/*" package naming conventions.

<info added on 2025-06-08T10:47:33.064Z>
Implementation progress update: Added vitest dependencies to root package.json and created vitest workspace configuration at root level. Successfully added test scripts to all package.json files and set up tools/vitest-config directory structure. However, encountered module resolution issues with the complex shared configuration approach, particularly ESM import/export complications with TypeScript extensions. Pivoting to a simplified approach by creating direct vitest.config.ts files in each package instead of relying on complex shared configuration dependencies. This new approach will be more reliable and better suited for the monorepo structure. Next steps include creating simple vitest.config.ts files directly in each package, testing configuration across all packages, and verifying turbo test orchestration works properly.

<info added on 2025-06-08T10:56:28.231Z>
Implementation successfully completed with full vitest workspace configuration. Added all required dependencies to root package.json including vitest, @vitest/ui, jsdom, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/react, and @testing-library/user-event. Created vitest.workspace.ts at root level for monorepo-wide test orchestration. Successfully added test, test:watch, and test:ui scripts to all package.json files. Created individual vitest.config.ts files for each package with environment-specific configurations - Node.js environment for lib, auth, billing, email, supabase, and types packages, and React/jsdom environment for ui and main-app packages. Verified functionality with passing sample tests including utils.test.ts in packages/lib and Button.test.tsx in packages/ui. Confirmed turbo test orchestration works correctly across all packages with proper TypeScript support, coverage reporting, and module resolution. The simplified direct configuration approach resolved previous ESM import/export complications and provides a robust testing foundation ready for development.
