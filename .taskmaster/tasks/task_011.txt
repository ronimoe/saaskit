# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Multi-Tenant Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add multi-tenant support with proper data isolation and tenant switching functionality
# Details:
Implement tenant-based Row Level Security policies, create tenant switching UI components, add tenant context providers, and ensure all database operations respect tenant boundaries. Implement UserProduct relationships and role-based access control as defined in the data models.

# Test Strategy:
Test data isolation between tenants, verify RLS policies prevent cross-tenant data access, test tenant switching functionality, validate role-based permissions work correctly, and ensure proper audit logging.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Row Level Security Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement tenant-based Row Level Security (RLS) policies in the database to ensure proper data isolation
### Details:
Create database functions and policies that automatically filter data based on tenant_id, implement RLS triggers on all tenant-related tables, and ensure all queries respect tenant context. Test with multiple tenant scenarios to verify complete isolation.

## 2. Develop Tenant Context Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create a tenant context provider to manage tenant identification and switching throughout the application
### Details:
Implement a context provider that maintains the current tenant ID in memory, provides methods to switch tenants, and ensures all database operations include the tenant context. Create hooks or utilities for components to access the current tenant context.

## 3. Build Tenant Switching UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Design and implement UI components that allow users to switch between tenants they have access to
### Details:
Create dropdown or sidebar components for tenant selection, implement visual indicators showing the current active tenant, and ensure the UI updates appropriately when tenant context changes. Include proper error handling for unauthorized tenant access attempts.

## 4. Implement UserProduct Relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create data models and database schema for UserProduct relationships with tenant awareness
### Details:
Design and implement database tables and relationships that associate users with products within specific tenant contexts. Ensure all queries and mutations respect tenant boundaries when accessing UserProduct data. Include migration scripts for existing data.

## 5. Implement Role-Based Access Control [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.4
### Description: Develop a tenant-aware role-based access control system as defined in the data models
### Details:
Create permission models that combine user roles with tenant context, implement middleware to verify permissions for all operations, and ensure UI components respect role-based restrictions. Include admin interfaces for managing roles within tenant contexts.
