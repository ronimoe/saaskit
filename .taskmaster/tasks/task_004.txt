# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Shared UI Component Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the shared UI package with reusable React components, Tailwind CSS styling, Radix UI integration, and design system. Utilize pnpm for efficient package management.
# Details:
Implement packages/ui with form components (Input, Select, Textarea), data display components (Table, Chart, StatCard), navigation components (Sidebar, Breadcrumb, Pagination), and feedback components (Toast, Modal, Loading). Include shared React hooks (useLocalStorage, useDebounce) with full TypeScript typings. Use pnpm for package management, configuring workspace dependencies and scripts for building, testing, and Storybook integration. Ensure proper linking between packages/ui and consuming apps. Follow the exact component structure from the PRD and maintain the specific folder structure: packages/ui/ (components/, styles/, icons/, themes/, utils/), apps/web/components/ (ui/ imports from @saas/ui), apps/web/app/ui-demo/ (component showcase page), packages/ui/src/components/ (Button.tsx, Input.tsx, Card.tsx, Modal.tsx), packages/ui/src/styles/ (globals.css, themes.css).

# Test Strategy:
Test components render correctly with various props, verify accessibility standards, test responsive behavior, validate TypeScript types, and ensure components work across different Next.js applications. Use pnpm scripts for testing and leverage React Testing Library for functional tests, focusing on behavior over implementation details. Achieve minimum 85% code coverage using Vitest for comprehensive unit testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Project Structure and Tooling with pnpm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the packages/ui directory, configure TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and set up the foundational project files for a scalable component library using pnpm.
### Details:
Create the folder structure for components, hooks, styles, and types. Initialize package.json with pnpm, install React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and related dependencies using pnpm add. Configure Tailwind and TypeScript for the library context. Set up pnpm workspace dependencies and scripts for building and testing. Follow the specific folder structure: packages/ui/ with subdirectories for components/, styles/, icons/, themes/, utils/, and ensure packages/ui/src/components/ contains initial files for Button.tsx, Input.tsx, Card.tsx, Modal.tsx, and packages/ui/src/styles/ includes globals.css and themes.css. Configure Vitest for testing with React Testing Library integration.

## 2. Implement Core Form Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop reusable Input, Select, and Textarea components with Tailwind CSS styling and TypeScript definitions.
### Details:
Follow the PRD structure for props and behavior. Ensure accessibility and consistent design. Document usage and props for each component. Place components in packages/ui/src/components/ directory following the established structure.

## 3. Build Data Display and Navigation Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create Table, Chart, StatCard, Sidebar, Breadcrumb, and Pagination components with shared design patterns and TypeScript support.
### Details:
Implement components as per PRD, ensuring modularity and reusability. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and maintain consistent API design. Place all components in the packages/ui/src/components/ directory with proper organization.

## 4. Add Feedback Components and Shared React Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement Toast, Modal, Loading components, and shared hooks (useLocalStorage, useDebounce) with full TypeScript typings.
### Details:
Ensure feedback components are accessible and hooks are generic and reusable. Document usage patterns and edge cases. Place components in packages/ui/src/components/ and hooks in packages/ui/src/utils/ following the established structure.

## 5. Finalize Design System Integration and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Integrate all components with the design system, ensure consistent theming, and provide comprehensive documentation and usage examples.
### Details:
Review all components for design consistency, update Tailwind configuration as needed, and write documentation covering props, usage, and customization. Create a component showcase page at apps/web/app/ui-demo/ to demonstrate all components. Ensure apps/web/components/ui/ correctly imports from @saas/ui.

## 6. Set Up Component Demo Page [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a dedicated UI component showcase page to demonstrate all components in action
### Details:
Implement the component showcase page at apps/web/app/ui-demo/ that demonstrates all UI components with various props and configurations. Ensure the page imports components from the correct location (apps/web/components/ui/ which imports from @saas/ui).

## 7. Configure pnpm Workspace and Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Set up pnpm workspace dependencies and scripts for building, testing, and Storybook integration.
### Details:
Configure pnpm workspace to manage dependencies between packages/ui and consuming apps. Set up scripts for building, testing, and Storybook integration using pnpm run commands. Ensure proper linking between packages.
