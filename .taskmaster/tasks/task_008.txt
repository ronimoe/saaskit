# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Dashboard and Protected Routes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the dashboard layout and all protected application routes with navigation
# Details:
Build (dashboard) route group with layout, navigation components (DashboardNav, Sidebar, UserMenu, TeamSwitcher), and all specified pages: projects, team, settings (profile, billing, integrations, security), and analytics. Implement proper data fetching, loading states, and error boundaries.

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard navigation works correctly, verify all protected routes require authentication, test data loading and error states, validate responsive design across devices, and ensure proper user experience flows.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Dashboard Layout and Navigation Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core dashboard layout structure with navigation components including DashboardNav, Sidebar, UserMenu, and TeamSwitcher
### Details:
Build the foundational layout for the dashboard using React components. Create reusable navigation components that will be used across all protected routes. Implement responsive design patterns to ensure the dashboard works on various screen sizes. Use a React component library or UI framework to accelerate development.

## 2. Implement Protected Route System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a protected route system that restricts access to authenticated users and handles route groups
### Details:
Set up route protection using React Router or similar routing library. Implement authentication checks to prevent unauthorized access. Create a route group structure for the dashboard that maintains the layout across different pages. Handle redirects for unauthenticated users.

## 3. Develop Primary Dashboard Pages [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Build the main dashboard pages including projects and team pages with appropriate data fetching and state management
### Details:
Implement the projects and team pages with data visualization components. Set up data fetching from backend APIs with proper loading states. Implement state management for user interactions and data updates. Create reusable components for common UI patterns across these pages.

## 4. Create Settings Pages [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement all settings pages including profile, billing, integrations, and security with appropriate forms and data management
### Details:
Build the settings section with separate pages for profile, billing, integrations, and security. Implement forms with validation for user input. Create data persistence logic to save user preferences and settings. Ensure consistent UI patterns across all settings pages.

## 5. Implement Analytics Dashboard with Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create the analytics dashboard with charts, data visualization, and implement error boundaries throughout the application
### Details:
Build an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and data visualization components. Implement error boundaries to gracefully handle component failures. Set up real-time or periodic data updates for analytics. Optimize performance for rendering large datasets using techniques like virtualization.
